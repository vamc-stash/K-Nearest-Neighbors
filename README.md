# K-Nearest-Neighbors

This repo implements KNN [Classification](https://github.com/vamc-stash/K-Nearest-Neighbors/blob/master/knnClassification.py) and [Regression](https://github.com/vamc-stash/K-Nearest-Neighbors/blob/master/knnRegression.py) algorithms from scratch in Python. <br>

Please read this [blog](https://medium.com/@rangavamsi5/k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-in-python-64f38792193) that goes with the code.
